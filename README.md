# SBA_308A

In this SBA, I attempted to correct the non-functioning parts of my previous project (favourites function as well as next/previous slides) while using the Dog API. 
Additionally, I implemented the fetch API approach instead of Axios.
Although the new implementation was succesful (in keeping with the original functionaility, I was unable to correct the dysfunctional methods of the previous project.
My efforts were focused on identifying the disconnect between the Event Listener and the DOM, as well as the elusive "Uncaught TypeError" related to the bootstrap package.

I look forward to constructive feedback on where the fundamental issues exist as well as how I could optimize my error handling approach.
Thank you.
